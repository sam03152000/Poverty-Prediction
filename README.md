## ABSTRACT
Determing appropriate prverty reduction strategies is hard. To do this, it requires measuring poverty in the first place.
The dataset provided by the World Bank conducted in-depth household surveys with a subset of the country's population. To measure poverty, most of these surveys collect detailed data on household consumption in order to get a clearer picture of a household's poverty status.

The aim of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict poverty for a specific country and utilized techniques such as data preprocessing, logistic regression, gradient descent and regularization.
