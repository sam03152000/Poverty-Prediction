## Abstract
Determing appropriate prverty reduction strategies is hard. To do this, it requires measuring poverty in the first place.
The dataset provided by World Bank conducted in-depth household surveys with a subset of the country's population. To measure poverty, most of these surveys collect detailed data on household consumption in order to get a clearer picture of a household's poverty status.

The aim of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict poverty for a specific country and utilized techniques such as data preprocessing, logistic regression, gradient descent and regularization.  

## Project Goal
1. build a logistic regression model with gradient descent

2. Compare our model to the scikit-learn package

3. Introduce regularization term to the model

4. Compare results with different train-test split

5. Compare results with different poverty prediction probability threshold

## Using the Software
The fitting code is written in Python and is demonstrated in the file STAT689_Poverty Prediction.ipynb.

## Performance matrics
We use log loss function to evaluate our results.
